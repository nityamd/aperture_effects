<h1>Aperture effects in Galaxy Mass Estimation</h1>

One of the most widely used Galaxy Mass catalogues,
the MPA-JHU catalog, relies on SDSS (Sloan Digital Sky Survey)
spectra and SDSS photometry to constrain galaxy masses.

The SDSS spectra are taken using optic fibers with
an angular diameter of 180 micrometers, i.e. spanning 3 arcseconds
in the sky. Thus the spectra are obtained for only a fraction
of the galaxy. However with the advent of Integral Field Units,
we can now obtain spatially resolved spectra of galaxies and
the largest IFU-based survey currently underway known as
MaNGA (Mapping Nearby galaxies at Apache Point) to test the
galaxy mass measurements made using the 3'' apertures.
